                        <p>My name is Aaron MacInnis and I'm beginning my journey into web based development. I'm excited and anxious to be starting a new endeavour a this point in my life. I've been a professional cook for over twenty years, and still have great passion, but need something challenging and more rewarding.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Also, we have a new addition to our family. The profile picture i chose is of our son Declan. I really tried to size the photo appropriately, but didn't quite succeed. I wasn't going to let that stop me.

                        In summary, I hope you have found this enjoyable and look forward to several other submissions.</p>
