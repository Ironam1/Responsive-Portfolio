          Hello, I'm Aaron MacInnis and welcome to my portfolio. I am a Full
          Stack developer with emphasis on Javascript, Node, and agile
          programming. Graduate from UPenn/Trilogy Bootcamp Full Stack Web
          Development. An excellent problem solver, I enjoy challenges and work
          well as either a team member or alone. Completed projects show
          strengths both in UX, through HTML and CSS, and back end technologies
          with server and database creation and management. Consistency and a
          strong work ethic make me a valuable asset in any work environment. An
          extensive career in the hospitality industry has given me strengths in
          communication, meeting deadlines and working towards a common goal.
        </p>
