        <p>
          My name is Aaron MacInnis and I'm beginning my journey into web based
          development. I'm excited and anxious to be starting a new endeavour a
          this point in my life. I've been a professional cook for over twenty
          years, and still have great passion, but need something challenging
          and more rewarding.
        </p>
        <p>
          My experience in the hospitality industry brings a diverse skill set
          that compensates for lack of experience in the web development field.
          I am a competent leader as well as a team player. I know how to meet
          deadlines with results and can manage several different compontents
          working toward a single goal.
        </p>
        <P
          >My portfolio showcases a few of the skills I have learned in a short
          period of time. This includes uses of firebase, basic javascript
          programming and API calls to multiple sources.</P
